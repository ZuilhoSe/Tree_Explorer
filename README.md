# Tree_Explorer
Tree_Explorer was developed for the 'Data Structures' course of FGV-EMAp. <br>
The objective of this project is to create a tree explorer in c++, which allows the user to navigate through the tree and see the information of each node, as well as the tree as a whole. <br>
This project also allows the user to turn the binary tree into a doubly linked list.<br>
To run the project, run the makefile using mingw64 and then run the executable file. <br>
