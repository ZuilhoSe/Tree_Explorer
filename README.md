# Tree_Explorer
Tree_Explorer was developed for the 'Data Structures' course of FGV-EMAp. <br>
The objective of this project is to create a tree explorer in c++, which allows the user to navigate through the tree and see the information of each node, as well as the tree as a whole. <br>
This project also allows the user to turn the binary tree into a doubly linked list, and see a graphical representation of the sorting. To make this possible, we used the [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) library. <br>
To run the project, run the [makefile](https://linuxhint.com/run-makefile-windows/) using [mingw](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/) and then run the executable file. <br>
